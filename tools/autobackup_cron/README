1. Create a backup directory, for an example /home/MaNGOS/backup/
2. Place the file backup.sh inside this directory and chmod it to rwxr-xr-x (0755)
3. Add a new task in CRON daemon, in the terminal window:

crontab -e (to open crontab in edit mode)
30 4 * * * bash /home/MaNGOS/backup/backup.sh
CTRL+O (to save)
CTRL+X (to exit crontab editor)

And one of these two to restart CRON and reload tasks list:
/etc/init.d/crond restart (Redhat, Cent or Fedora)
/etc/init.d/cron restart (Debian or Ubuntu)

Backup will be automatically dumped and gziped at 4:30 AM every single day into a separate folder, in YYYYMMDD-HHMM format. Look into backup.sh file for few variables to modify.
